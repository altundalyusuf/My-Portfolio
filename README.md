## 📖 Project Context
This project serves as my digital resume. It was developed to practice **Next.js (App Router)** and **TypeScript** fundamentals while building a functional portfolio.

### 💡 Credits & Adaptation
The visual design and core structure were based on a tutorial by [Mif2006](https://github.com/Mif2006). I followed the implementation guide to understand the best practices of Framer Motion and Swiper.js integration.

**My Key Contribution:**
While the original design served as a baseline, I identified responsiveness issues on smaller screens. **I manually refactored the CSS/Tailwind classes to ensure the site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly**, optimizing the layout for all devices.
